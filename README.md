# **Project 1 : Red Wine Quality Prediction Project**
The 'Red Wine Quality Prediction project' have objective to develop a machine learning model that can predict the quality of red wines based on various chemical features. Red wine quality is a critical factor in the wine industry, and being able to predict it accurately can help winemakers enhance their production processes and improve overall product quality.
## Problem Statement for Red Wine Quality Prediction
To develop a predictive machine learning model that can accurately predict the quality of red wines based on physicochemical properties.Can assign a quality score between 0 and 10 to each wine.
## ML Model
1. ML Model 1 - Logistic Regression with all variables
2. ML Model 2 - Logistic Regression with dropping categorical variable
3. ML Model 3 - Logistic Regression with treatment on outliers
4. ML Model 4 - Logistic Regression with considering columns after outlier treatment. Cosidering variable with respect to correlation, liner relations.
5. ML Model 5 - Decision Tree Model
6. ML Model 6 - Random Forest Classifier Model
7. ML Model 7 - k-Neighbors Classifier
8. ML Model 8 - SVM classifier Model
## Conclusion
From all the models above, we can observe that the RandomForestClassifier model consistently provides the best results both before and after tuning. Additionally, when evaluating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for both class 0 and 1, it outperforms other models.


# **Project 2 : Medical Cost Personal Insurance Project**
The 'Medical Cost Personal Insurance' project aims to develop machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model that estimates individual medical costs for health insurance. This project is based on a dataset that includes various features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and actual medical costs. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict medical expenses, which will helpful for both insurance providers and policyholders to make more informed decisions and better manage healthcare costs.
## Problem Statement for Medical Cost Personal Insurance Project
To develop a predictive machine learning model which accurately predict individual medical costs for personal insurance, considering variables like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
## ML Model
1. ML Model 1 - Linear regression with all variables
2. ML Model 2 - Linear regression with all categorical variables
3. ML Model 3 - Linear regression with treatment on outliers
4. ML Model 5 - Decision Tree Model
5. ML Model 7 - k-Neighbors Classifier
6. ML Model 6 - Support Vector Regression Model

## Conclusion
Among the six ML models, Model No. 1, which is the linear regression model, achieved the best MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R2 scores. All other models performed less favorably compared to the linear regression model.
